# Machine-Learning-2020-2021---Challenge
This project is an assignment from the first machine learning course I took at Sapienza University of Rome. The goal of the assignment is to perform the necessary pre processing and experiment with different machine learning algorithms to build a review score classifier for a dataset of video games.
